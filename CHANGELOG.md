## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd

## [1.17.1] - 2024-07-22

### Fixed

- Update process breaks with "KeyError" exception when encountering invalid distributions.

## [1.17.0] - 2024-07-13

### Added

- Recurring time for update notifications can now be specified precisely and in natural language:
  - In the last release we introduced a new feature that allows receiving update notifications less often, e.g. only once a day or once a week. This release replaces the "timeout" implementation of that feature with a "schedule" implementation. The schedule implementation allows the user to define a concrete schedule for update notifications in natural language, e.g. "every day at 12 o'clock".
  - To try out this new feature we recommend the following settings. This will produce a daily notification about any pending updates at 18:00:
    - `PACKAGE_MONITOR_NOTIFICATIONS_SCHEDULE = "every day at 18:00"`
    - `PACKAGE_MONITOR_NOTIFICATIONS_REPEAT = True`
  - For more details please see the documentation for the new settings: `PACKAGE_MONITOR_NOTIFICATIONS_SCHEDULE`.

### Changed

- The timeout setting introduced in the last release has been removed.

## [1.16.0] - 2024-06-18

### Added

- You can now set a timeout for update notifications, so that update notifications will be sent less often, e.g. only once every 24 hours. This is disabled by default to keep the existing behavior. For more info see the new setting: `PACKAGE_MONITOR_NOTIFICATIONS_TIMEOUT` in the README.

- You can now choose to get repeated notifications about the same updates. This is useful in combination with the new timeout feature and works like a repeating reminder. This feature is disabled by default to keep the existing behavior. For more info see the new setting: `PACKAGE_MONITOR_NOTIFICATIONS_REPEAT` in the README. This is off by default.

### Changed

- Combine messages when multiple package update are available (#14)

## [1.15.1] - 2024-03-22

### Fixed

- TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable (#15)

## [1.15.0] - 2024-03-20

### Added

- Some updates to installed packages might also trigger updates of other packages, which could potentially break the current AA installation. For example: if you have aa-esi-status v1.x installed with Alliance Auth v3 and update to aa-esi-status v2.x, it will automatically also update to Alliance Auth to v4, which would then requires additional manual installation steps or AA will no longer function.

To address this, such potentially unwanted updates can now be automatically excluded for specific packages. See also setting `PACKAGE_MONITOR_PROTECTED_PACKAGES` for details.

### Changed

- Available updates to installed packages, which would also cause an update to Django or Alliance Auth, will no longer be shown. See also setting `PACKAGE_MONITOR_PROTECTED_PACKAGES` for details.

## [1.12.0] - 2023-07-25

## [1.5.0] - 2022-08-02

### Update notes

This version is changing the default to showing all packages. So if you have been using the default you might suddenly see a lot of missing updates after installing this patch. Our main rationale for changing this is that during the update to AA3 we have seen many users running outdated packages, which have caused problems.

### Changed

- Changing the default to showing all packages.
- Unused `filterDropDown.js` removed from template (!6)

## [1.4.2] - 2022-06-18

### Changed

- Reverted copy-to-clipboard logic back execCommand approach. While this approach is officially deprecated, it works in more scenarios (e.g. does not requires HTTPS).

### Fixed

- `KeyError: 'latest'`
